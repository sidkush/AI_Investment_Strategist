   - **Company Researcher:** Summarizes company profiles, financials, and the latest news.
   - **Stock Strategist:** Synthesizes performance and company fundamentals to recommend top stocks.
   - **Team Lead:** Aggregates all insights into a structured, investor-friendly report.

3. **Interactive Visualization:**  
   Uses Plotly to display interactive stock performance charts, making trend analysis intuitive.

4. **User Input:**  
   Investors can input one or more stock symbols and (optionally) their own API key for enhanced security and customization.
